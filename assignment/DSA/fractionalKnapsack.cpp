/*
 Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity w to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
 In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack.
 
 The basic idea is to calculate the ratio value/weight for each item and sort the item on basis of this ratio.
 Then take the item with the highest ratio and add them until we can't add the next item as a whole and at the end add the next item as much as we can.
 Which will always be the optimal solution to this problem.

 As main time taking step is sorting, the whole problem can be solved in O(n log n) only.
