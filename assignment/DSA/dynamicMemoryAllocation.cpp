/*
Dynamic Memory allocation can be defined as a procedure in which the size of a data structure is changed during the runtime.
 
malloc(): It is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size.
 
calloc(): It is used to dynamically allocate the specified number of blocks of memory of the specified type. It initializes each block with a default value '0'.
 
**If space is insufficient, allocation fails and returns a NULL pointer (in both malloc and calloc).
 
free(): It is used to dynamically de-allocate the memory. The memory allocated using functions malloc() and calloc() are not de-allocated on their own. Hence the free() method is used.
 
realloc(): It is used to dynamically change the memory allocation of a previously allocated memory.
 
new() and delete() are two extra keywords for dynamic memory.
 
** All dynamically allocated variables are placed in the heap space and thus they have program-lifetime.
